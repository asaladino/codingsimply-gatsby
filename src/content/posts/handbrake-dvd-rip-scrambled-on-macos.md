### Overview

Do you need to [record a dvd clip for commentary](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/its-still-illegal-to-rip-dvd-and-blu-ray-discs-for-personal-use/)? Chances are you will use [Handbrake](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake) since it is free, open source, and actively developed.

### Installation

Since I am using macOS, I like to install HandBrake using¬†[brew](http://brewformulas.org/Handbrake).

brew install handbrake

### DVD Recording

Now that HandBrake is installed, insert your dvd and start recording! However, you will get a scrambled mess üôÅ because the dvd is encrypted.

Scrambled DVD recording.

Not a problem. Close HandBrake and install [libdvdcss](http://brewformulas.org/Libdvdcss) library with brew.

brew install libdvdcss

Open Handbrake and your recording will no longer be scrambled.
