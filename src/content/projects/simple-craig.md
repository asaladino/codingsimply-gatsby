Prototype iOS app for posting items to Craig's List that was built with Matt D. Smith
[@mds](https://twitter.com/mds). This was the project where Matt created the popular [float label](https://twitter.com/floatlabel).

The project was scraped because we couldn't figure out a way to make it profitable.

>Adam is one of the most capable developers I've ever had the privilege   of working with. His knowledge extends beyond every possible  programming  language he chooses to learn and executeâ€”into the deeper  'why' behind  the decisions used to inform development in the first  place. If you have  the rare opportunity to have Adam writing your code,  seize it!
