The University of Hartford needed to keep track of processes and definitions and how they relate to each other. The Data Dictionary site is designed such that, each group at the University was required to keep updated information about the definitions they use. Moreover, they needed to make sure they agreed on definitions when that definitions spanned several groups.

The site backend was created with Symfony and the frontend was written with Reactjs.
