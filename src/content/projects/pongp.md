Pong for python is using pygame, pyqt5, and tensorflow. This game is based on [Siraj's pong neural network](http://github.com/llSourcell/pong_neural_network_live) and [video](http://youtu.be/Hqf__FlRlzg).Â It can have 0 to 2 players.

The idea behind the game is for the AI player to learn how to play by watching you play or by playing against a logical computer player.
