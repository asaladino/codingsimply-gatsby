Campy Creatures is a board game by [Keymaster Games](https://keymastergames.com/). The companion apps allow for game play without needing to carry game pieces. The original version of the app was developed by another team using the Iconic Framework but the app was sluggish html web app that provided a poor user experience. So, Mattox had me rewrite the app into native apps on Android (kotlin) and iOS (swift). The rewrite took about a week for each app.
