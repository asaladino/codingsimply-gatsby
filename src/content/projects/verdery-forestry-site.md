The Verdery Forestry Site ([https://landandtrees.com](https://landandtrees.com)) was originally a custom PHP site written with CakePHP but later migrated to Wordpress. The site is using a modified child theme, custom post types and advanced custom fields to power projects lists and handle the mailing list. A custom plugin was created to migrate data from the previous site and help manage subscriptions.
