EyeBrowse is a fun prototype iOS browser app. The goals of this project were:

- Learn swift. This project was written for swift 1 but since updated to be compatible with swift 3.
- Create my own private iOS browser.
- Create a browser that would interface with OpenDNS filters. This did not happen, since OpenDNS does not a public api.

## Features

For a prototype, the browser has a lot of features.

- Independent browsing history and bookmarks.
- Page sharing.
- Tabbed pages.
