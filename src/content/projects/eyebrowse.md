EyeBrowse is a fun prototype iOS browser app. The goals of this project were:

*  Learn swift. This project was written for swift 1 but since updated to be compatible with swift 3.
*  Create my own private iOS browser.
*  Create a browser that would interface with OpenDNS filters. This did not happen, since OpenDNS does not a public api.

## Features

For a prototype, the browser has a lot of features.

*  Independent browsing history and bookmarks.
*  Page sharing.
*  Tabbed pages.
