Neighbors in a custom social network designed to give moderators more control over community interaction than was available on Nextdoor. 

The institution that commissioned the application use a windows stack, so the Neighbors back-end was build using asp.net mvc written in c#. Authentication for the community was handled by Facebook and mapping was provided by MapQuest. The front-end is a hybrid React PWA with additional native integration with an existing mobile using Swift and Java.
